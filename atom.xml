    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three weeks ago I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/chalup/proguard-please">proguard-please</a> plugin. I was super excited by this project because:</p>

<ol>
<li>It was a Gradle plugin, something I wanted to play with for quite some time</li>
<li>It was written in Groovy, a language I wanted to play with for quite some time</li>
<li>It solved a real issue with ProGuard configuration, which was pissing me off for quite some time</li>
</ol>


<h2>On configuring ProGuard</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with ProGuard, here&rsquo;s the basic info: it&rsquo;s a program which prunes the unused code from your compiled Java program. It can also do other stuff like optimization or code obfuscation and repackaging to make the reverse engineering harder. Sounds good? The catch is that ProGuard sometimes cuts out or obfuscates too much code, which usually breaks the app, especially if you rely on reflection. The trick is to configure it correctly for each library you use, but it&rsquo;s not a trivial task.</p>

<p>The general idea for this plugin was to resolve the dependencies of your Android application and try to find the ProGuard configuration for every one of them. Of course the ProGuard config will not magically appear: the idea was to have a repository of configurations developed by the community.</p>

<h2>On Gradle</h2>

<p>First part of the project went really smooth, thanks to the <a href="http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/userguide.html">amazing documentation</a>. I didn&rsquo;t need to do any fancy stuff, so I was able to configure the basic scaffolding in no time at all. Docs for android gradle plugin are pretty much non-existent, but using the imported sources and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/hvisser/android-apt">android-apt</a> plugin by <a href="https://twitter.com/botteaap">Hugo Visser</a> as a base for Android related tasks I was able to get my plugin up and running.</p>

<h2>On Groovy</h2>

<p>I saw the Groovy for the first time at KrakDroid conference, when <a href="https://github.com/wojtekerbetowski">Wojciech Erbetowski</a> converted boring JUnit tests into <a href="https://github.com/Polidea/RoboSpock">RoboSpock</a> goodness. It looked nice, but when I started coding in Groovy, my love for this language faded.</p>

<p>There are lot of things I take for granted as a Java developer: amazing IDE, instant feedback when I screw something up and documentation for the code under my cursor at my fingertips. Maybe switching to Groovy, Ruby or Python requires some mindset change I haven&rsquo;t fully embraced, but I simply cannot imagine why would I switch to the language that effectively forces me to write my code in Notepad™.</p>

<p>I think the main problem I have with Groovy stems for the fact that there are some APIs that wouldn&rsquo;t typecheck in regular Java. Consider this code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='groovy'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(!</span><span class="n">project</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">android</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;productFlavors&quot;</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="na">isEmpty</span><span class="o">())</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">ProjectConfigurationException</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;The build flavors are not supported yet&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kt">def</span> <span class="n">obfuscatedVariants</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">project</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">android</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;applicationVariants&quot;</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="na">findAll</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">obfuscation</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="kc">null</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s a classic type of what I call &ldquo;string typing&rdquo;: depending on the key used in <code>project.android[]</code> access you get collection of objects of completely different type. As a consequence, the IDE cannot provide you with autocompletion or documentation for the collection contents.</p>

<p>Another example is the public API of Grgit library. Theoretically you can call <code>Grgit.clone(...)</code>, but there is no such method as <code>clone</code> in <code>Grgit</code> class, instead you have this code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s wrong with the good ol&#8217; static method and what do you achieve by using <code>methodMissing</code> (besides confusing the IDE and breaking autocomplete/javadocs). Maybe I&rsquo;m just grupy old fart with brain eroded by too long exposure to Java, but Groovy is definitely not a language for me. I&rsquo;ll put up with it if I ever want to write another gradle plugin, but it&rsquo;s not going to be my go to language.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s up with the blog title?</h2>

<p>Few hours after publishing my project, another solution for ProGuard configuration appeared. It turns out, if you use gradle to build your library, you can configure <code>consumerProguardFiles</code> property to include in your aar package a ProGuard configuration that should be used by the users of your library. The logical next step is creating the library project containing only the ProGuard configuration for the most popular libraries out there. And that&rsquo;s exactly what <a href="https://bitbucket.org/littlerobots/squadleader">squadleader</a> project is.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as flexible solution as my <a href="https://github.com/chalup/proguard-please">proguard-please</a> plugin, but it&rsquo;s much simpler, much easier to contribute to and the net effect is the same. In this light I chose to put my project on hold and redirect developers to squadleader page.</p>

<p>Despite of that, I&rsquo;m glad I worked on this project. I&rsquo;m very excited by the fact that you can easily build an useful tool that&rsquo;s incredibly easy to use. Using gradle for a new build system was a great call.</p>

    <link href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/07/03/android-recent-apps-list-and-intent-extras/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-03T22:14:06+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/07/03/android-recent-apps-list-and-intent-extras</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re programming for the same platform for some time, you have probably developed some habits. You do some stuff in a particular way, because you&rsquo;ve always done it this way. It might be a good thing if you know all pros and cons of your solution, because your code will be consistent and you don&rsquo;t waste time rethinking the same things over and over again. On the other hand it is a good practice to question this established ways of doing things from time to time &ndash; maybe you&rsquo;ve missed something when you thought about this last time or some of your arguments are no longer valid.</p>

<p>For me one of such things was the <code>Serializable</code> vs. <code>Parcelable</code> conundrum. A long time ago I read somewhere that <code>Serializable</code> is much slower than <code>Parcelable</code> and it shouldn&rsquo;t be used for large objects, but it&rsquo;s fast enough for passing simple POJOs between <code>Fragments</code> and <code>Activities</code> with <code>Intent</code> or arguments <code>Bundle</code>. While this is still a generally good advice, I realized I don&rsquo;t know how much faster the <code>Parcelable</code> is. Are we looking at 10µs vs. 15µs or 10µs vs. 10ms?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m too lazy to write a benchmark myself, but I found a <a href="http://www.developerphil.com/parcelable-vs-serializable/">decent article</a>. Tl;dr: on modern hardware (Nexus 4) serializing a simple data structure takes about 2ms and using <code>Parcelable</code> is about 10 times faster.</p>

<p>Another hit on Google was a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1daiib/parcelable_vs_serializable/">reddit thread</a> for this article. I found there an interesting comment by <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/+JakeWharton">+Jake Wharton</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Serializable is like a tattoo. You are committing to a class name, package, and field structure forever. The only way to &#8220;remove&#8221; it is epic deserialization hacks.</p><p>Yes using it in an Intent isn&#8217;t much harm, but if you use serialization there&#8217;s a potential for crashing your app. They upgrade, hit your icon on the launcher, and Android tries to restore the previous Intent for where they were at in your app. You changed the object so deserialization fails and the app crashes. Not a good upgrade experience. Granted this is rare, but if you ever persist something to disk like this it can leave you in an extremely bad place.</p></blockquote>


<p>There are two inaccuracies in the comment above. First, the problem will happen only if the app is started from the recet apps list, not from the launcher icon. Second, the problem is not limited to <code>Serializable</code> extras: <code>Parcelable</code> might read the byte stream originally written from a different structure (in this situation crash is a best case scenario), some extras might be missing, some might hold wrong type of data.</p>

<p>Can you prevent this issue? I don&rsquo;t think so, at least not without some sophisticated validation of Intent extras. Considering that this issue is very rare and it goes away after starting the faulty app from somewhere else than recent apps list I don&rsquo;t think you should spend any time trying to fix it, but it&rsquo;s good to know about it, as it might explain some WTF crash reports coming your way.</p>

    <link href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/06/27/google-i-slash-o-2014-summary/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-27T21:34:11+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/06/27/google-i-slash-o-2014-summary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are my thoughts after watching the keynote and few Android related sessions.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<h3>Android One</h3>

<p>This might be a huge, not only because it means expanding the potential user base for your apps. The most important thing is that all these new devices will run the latest Android and software updates will be provided by Google. If this kind of support becomes standard, we might be able to use <code>minSdkVersion=20</code> pretty soon.</p>

<h3>ART</h3>

<p>The Dalvik was decomissioned, the new runtime is the only runtime. I do hope this means that the 64k method limit is no longer a problem and there are no technical roadblocks for Java 8 support. Maybe this questions were answersed during <a href="https://www.google.com/events/io/schedule/session/b750c8da-aebe-e311-b297-00155d5066d7">The ART runtime</a> session, unfortunately there was no live stream of it.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: the video from the session is available. The GC improvements and performance boosts are amazing, but if I understand everything correctly the ART still uses dex bytecode underneath, so all Dalvik limitations are still in place.   Bad Google.</p>

<h3><a href="https://plus.google.com/+XavierDucrohet/posts">+Xavier Ducrohet</a></h3>

<p>I got the feeling that he&rsquo;s the only Google employee who acknowledges that there are serious issues with developing on Android. Great answers about unit tests and robolectric support, good answer about Scala support.</p>

<h2>Dunno what to make of it</h2>

<h3>RecyclerView</h3>

<p><code>ListViews</code> are far from perfect. I know, because in our codebase we have few workarounds for the issues or poor APIs. It&rsquo;s good that something more flexible is available, it&rsquo;s great that it&rsquo;s a part of support library, but some parts of the <code>RecyclerView</code> API look incredibly complex.</p>

<h3>Unlock bypass with Wear device</h3>

<p>Call me paranoid, but this feature means that if I get mugged, I&rsquo;m totally screwed. Someone gets access to my email, and through that he gets access to every piece of my data on the web and my digital idendity. Thanks, I&rsquo;ll pass.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are users who do not use pin or pattern on the lockscreens. For these people, this feature is a significant security improvement.</p>

<h2>Lowlights</h2>

<h3>Always running, big-ass TVs</h3>

<p>During keynote one speaker mentioned that in average household the TV is on for 5 hours every day and suggested that for the other 19 hours it can be used as a digital canvas for your content. I&rsquo;m not sure if encouraging people to keep the huge, power hungry device all the time to display nice pictures is very thoughtful and enviromentally aware.</p>

<h3>Fireside chat</h3>

<p>There were some über lame questions from the audience, but that&rsquo;s expected when questions are not moderated. However there were also über lame answers for valid questions, and there is no excuse for it.</p>

<p>The very first question, about Java 8 support, was answered with smirks and a slimy answer from Chet Haase. Dear Google, after WWDC the Java 8 support is no longer a huge news, so if you&rsquo;re saving it for the future, don&rsquo;t bother. And if there are any issues with Java 8 support &ndash; legal, technical, whatever &ndash; just let the developers know.</p>

    <link href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/06/20/on-git-ui/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-20T13:40:12+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/06/20/on-git-ui</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As madeupstatistics.com report, 95% posts about git can be divided into three types:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Whining about rebases, because &ldquo;git history is a bunch of lies&rdquo;.</p>

<p>   Right, because everyone needs to see your &ldquo;fixed typo&rdquo; mistakes and early API design blunders.</p></li>
<li><p>Whining about rebases, because you should document the &ldquo;roads not taken&rdquo;, not obliterate them.</p>

<p> This argument is actually pretty good, but from my experience these not taken roads, dead ends and detours do not tell the full story either. VCS is not the right tool for this.</p></li>
<li><p>Whining about crappy CLI command names.</p>

<p> It&rsquo;s hard to defend some choices, but here&rsquo;s the thing: you need to memorize maybe a dozen commands and in return you get the most powerful VCS tool you can get today. So toughen up princess, stop whining and learn them.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So today I was pleasantly surprised when I found today actually a <a href="http://tonsky.me/blog/reinventing-git-interface/">good blog post about git UI</a>. Go ahead and read it. While I do not agree with everything OP wrote, he got two things right: git model and <code>git log --graph</code> improvements.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://tonsky.me/blog/reinventing-git-interface/overview@2x.png"></p>

<h2>Git Mental Model</h2>

<p>People do not need to know that there are blobs, sha checksum calculated from whatnot and so one. What I say to every git newcomer is this: <strong>commits are connected with parent commits, and branches, tags, HEAD, etc. are all just pointers to commits</strong>. Then you just need to figure out that <code>git commit</code> doesn&rsquo;t do any magic, it just adds commit and moves HEAD and current branch pointers.</p>

<h2>Commits Graph Representation</h2>

<p>Every git workflow description contain a beautiful, clear diagram explaining where commits are added and merged &ndash; <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">this is a good example</a>. Then you start using this workflow and after two weeks your <code>git log --graph --all</code> output looks like a failed knitting experiment. The difference is that the diagrams keep the commits from a single branch aligned in a column, and <code>git log</code> tries to reduce the space taken by graph, which mixes multiple branches in a single column.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s doable with current git data model though &ndash; the commits do not contain any information about the branch. I think the branch name could be derived from the current branches and merge commits messages, but I&rsquo;m sure it won&rsquo;t work for 100% of cases. For these edge cases it would be great to allow users to manually select the correct branch, but this means the branch information would have to be kept outside of commits, but inside git. Tricky stuff.</p>

    <link href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/06/15/minsdkversion-equals-15/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-15T09:29:50+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/06/15/minsdkversion-equals-15</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago <a href="https://twitter.com/readyState">Jeff Gilfelt</a> was giving away <code>minSdkVersion=14</code> stickers, promoting the idea of dumping the support for Gingerbread and Honeycomb. What seemed radical one year ago, today is a widely accepted. The <code>minSdkVersion</code> in new project wizard in latest Android Studio release is by default set to <code>15</code>. On the same screen you can click the &ldquo;help me choose&rdquo; hyperlink, which shows this screen:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chalup.github.io/images/android_studio_min_sdk.png"></p>

<p>The percentages are consistent with data from <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">developer.android.com</a> dashboards, but I&rsquo;d say they are skewed towards old Android versions. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.futuresimple.base">Base CRM</a> app I&rsquo;m working on has only 3.7% active users on devices with api level &lt; 15 (compared to 17.4% from official Google dashboards). Moreover, if you look only at the new users, the Froyo, GingerBread and Honeycomb is used only by 1%. In this light, supporting pre-API15 devices is a criminal waste, and starting new projects with minSdkVersion lower than 15 a criminal idiocy.</p>

<p>For me, as a delevoper, the <code>minSdkVersion=14</code> is a breakthrough, mostly because of Holo theme available everywhere. I no longer have to worry about <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2012/03/08/customizing-ui-controls-on-android/">HTC rounded green buttons and such when creating custom views</a> &ndash; I only have to make them look good with a single theme. Theoretically one could have used <a href="https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere">HoloEverywhere lib</a>, but it&rsquo;s not a drop-in replacement. First you have to switch to using their Views instead of native ones and adjusting any external UI library to use them as well.</p>

<p>I looked through the <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/index.html">Android changelogs</a> wondering what could be the next version on <code>minSdkVersion</code> stickers. The next step is a small bump to JellyBean (API level 16), which gives us access to actions in system notifications and <code>condensed</code> and <code>light</code> Roboto font variants. Official statictics state that Ice Cream Sandwich is used by 12.3% of users, but this number is much higher than the one from Base statistics &ndash; 5.87%. I expect dropping support for ICS this year.</p>

<p>But then? I don&rsquo;t see anything as groundbreaking as dropping Gingerbread. I don&rsquo;t even see anything with more impact than dropping ICS. Theoretically API level 17 gives access to nested fragments, but I think you should be using support-v4 classes anyways (and if you check the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.samples.apps.iosched">Google I/O 2014</a> app sources, Google developers seem to think so too). Maybe there&rsquo;s something I missed or something crucial for specific use cases &ndash; do let me know if there&rsquo;s anything in API levels 17-19 you wish you could use already.</p>

<p>Google I/O is coming though, and <a href="https://twitter.com/GabMarioPower/status/477040313832583168">some things indicate</a> we might see Android 5.0 (or at least Android 4.5). Maybe this Android &ldquo;L&rdquo; version will be another breakthrough in development? My personal wish is a new runtime without <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=20814">ridiculous 64k method limit</a>. Of course this opens a lot of other possibilities. Maybe support for Java 8? Or first-class support for other JVM languages? We&rsquo;ll see&hellip;</p>

<p>When I first saw this API I was a bit worried about performance, because this code is supposed to be used in <code>Comparator</code>s, which are executed multiple times during <code>Collection</code> sorting, and it looks like it could allocate a lot of objects. So I looked at the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/source/browse/guava/src/com/google/common/collect/ComparisonChain.java">source code</a> and I was enlightened.</p>

<p>ComparisonChain is an abstract class with few versions of <code>compare</code> method returning ComparisonChain object:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To get the result of comparison you call another abstract method:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">abstract</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">result</span><span class="o">();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The trick is, there are only two implementations and three instances of ComparisonChain: anonymous <code>ACTIVE</code>, and <code>LESS</code> and <code>GREATER</code> instances of InactiveComparisonChain.</p>

<p><code>ACTIVE</code> instance is the one you get from <code>ComparisonChain.start()</code> call. Various <code>compare</code> methods in <code>ACTIVE</code> instance perform comparison on supplied arguments, and depending on result return <code>ACTIVE</code>, <code>LESS</code> or <code>GREATER</code> object. Calling <code>result</code> on <code>ACTIVE</code> ComparisonChain yields 0.</p>

<p>InactiveComparisonChain&rsquo;s instances &ndash; <code>LESS</code> and <code>GREATER</code> &ndash; do not perform any comparisons and return themselves &ndash; if you got this object, it means that earlier comparison already established the result. The role of this object is just to forward <code>result</code> call to appropriate instance. <code>LESS.result()</code> returns -1 and <code>GREATER.result()</code> +1.</p>

<p>The whole class is elegant, provide beautiful API for a common task and the implementation is very efficient. The world needs more code like this.</p>

    <updated>2014-06-12T21:52:43+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/06/12/android-loaders</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you fetch the data from any <code>ContentProvider</code> in your application, the most likely scenarios are:</p>

<ol>
<li>You&rsquo;re absolutely clueless and fetch the data on UI thread.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re using an <code>AsyncTask</code> and:

<ul>
<li>Your app crashes on screen orientation change.</li>
<li>You block the screen orientation, because you googled this &ldquo;solution&rdquo; on StackOverflow.</li>
<li>You wrote error prone boilerplate code to detach and reattach the <code>AsyncTask</code> from the Activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are using <code>CursorLoader</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p>But accessing <code>ContentProvider</code> is probably not the only type of asynchronous operations you perform. You might want to access <code>SharedPreferences</code>, read a file or query a web API. In that case you need <code>Loader&lt;SomeOtherDataThanCursor&gt;</code>, but implementing one correctly is a bit tricky.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll walk you through the entire process of understanding how the Loaders work, implementing a sane base class for your Loaders, implementing <code>CursorLoader</code> with all issues fixed and extending it to allow multiple notification Uris. It&rsquo;ll be a long post so grab a cup of your favourite beverage.</p>

<h2>Loaders 101</h2>

<p>Loader should do three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Load data in background thread.</li>
<li>Cache the loaded data, so you won&rsquo;t reload it after screen orientation change.</li>
<li>If applicable, monitor the data source and reload the data when necessary.</li>
</ol>


<p>The Loader class itself doesn&rsquo;t provide any mechanism for loading the data in background thread. You either have to implement this yourself, or you can subclass the <code>AsyncTaskLoader</code>. This covers the first point on our requirements list.</p>

<p>The 2nd point is not handled by <code>AsyncTaskLoader</code>. In fact the <code>AsyncTaskLoader</code> is far from being fully functional, for example this perfectly reasonable looking implementation won&rsquo;t work:</p>

<h2>AbstractLoader v1</h2>

<p>A good starting point for creating either <code>CursorLoader</code> implementation or LoaderCustom.java from SDK samples. Here&rsquo;s the common part of these two implementations, which provides all necessary boilerplate for loading and caching the data:</p>

<p>But why do we need all that code? The key to understanding the Loaders is understanding the expected Loader&rsquo;s behaviour in different states: started, stopped, abandoned and reset. Upon entering each state, the appropriate callback is executed:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>onStartLoading</code>: the Loader was created and should either load the data or return cached data.</li>
<li><code>onStopLoading</code>: the Loader should keep the cached data and monitor the data source for changes, but it shouldn&rsquo;t load the data. This happens for example when users presses home button from your app.</li>
<li><code>onAbandoned</code>: someone restarted the Loader. New instance of this Loader was created in <code>onCreateLoader</code> callback in your <code>Fragment</code>/<code>Activity</code>/whatever and loads new data. The abandoned Loader should keep the data until the new Loader loads and delivers it&rsquo;s data. There is no point of monitoring data source or reloading the data in abandoned Loader &ndash; the data will be loaded by the new instance. When new Loader delivers it&rsquo;s data this Loader will be reset.</li>
<li><code>onReset</code>: the data previously loaded by this Loader are no longer used and should be cleaned up. This Loader might be started again, so make sure you clean up also any old state in your Loader implementation.</li>
</ul>


<p>The <code>AsyncTaskLoader</code> provides additional callback:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>onCancelled</code>: called after data loading when it turns out that this data is no longer needed, for example when the <code>AsyncTask</code> executing your <code>onLoadInBackground</code> was cancelled. In this callback you should take care of releasing resources.</li>
</ul>


<p>Since the releasing resources should be also performed in <code>onReset</code> callback and in our deliverResults implementation, our AbstractLoader class provides handy <code>releaseResources()</code> callback for closing your <code>Cursor</code>s, file handles, etc.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s walk through our <code>AbstractLoader</code> implementation. When someone starts our Loader using <code>LoaderManager.initLoader()</code>, the <code>onStartLoading</code> is called:</p>

<p>We keep the loaded data in <code>mResult</code> member of our <code>AbstractLoader</code>. If we have already loaded the data, we can just deliver the results to Loader clients. If the cache is empty or the Loader was notified about new data available for fetching, we force data reload by calling <code>forceLoad()</code> method. It starts <code>AsyncTask</code> which executes <code>loadInBackground</code> in background thread and the result is passed to <code>deliverResults</code> function:</p>

<p>A lot of interesting things happen here. First, we check if the loader was put into <code>reset</code> state. In this state all the previous resources were already released, so we just need to take care of newly loaded data. Then we swap the data in cache, call <code>deliverResults</code> in Loader and then release the resources for previously cached data.</p>

<p>When the Fragment or Activity with active Loader is stopped, the Loaders are also put in the stopped state. It means that they should keep the cached data, monitor if this data is still valid, but they should not actively load the data or deliver the results to UI thread. In terms of <code>AsyncTaskLoader</code> it means that any running <code>AsyncTasks</code> should be cancelled:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Current implementation of <code>AsyncTaskLoader</code> do not interrupt the active tasks, it only marks that the results of these tasks should not be delivered to the UI thread. However, the results might require some resource releasing, so the <code>onCancelled</code> callback is called:</p>

<p>The last callback we have to implement is <code>onReset</code>:</p>

<p>There are two important things here. First, the Loader can be moved to reset state from started state, which means it can still have active <code>AsyncTasks</code> executing <code>loadInBackground</code>. We need to stop them first. Then, as per the specified contract, we have to release the resources and clear the cache.</p>

<p>What about <code>onAbandoned</code> callback? AbstractLoader doesn&rsquo;t monitor any data source by itself, so this callback doesn&rsquo;t have to be implemented.</p>

<h2>CursorLoader</h2>

<p>So how would we implement observing a data source and automatic reloading? Let&rsquo;s see how would the <code>CursorLoader</code> implementation look like had we used our AbstractLoader as a base class (literally; if you merge MyCursorLoader and AbstractLoader code samples from this post, you&rsquo;ll get exactly the CursorLoader implementation from support-v4):</p>

<p>This implementation has two bugs and one kind-of-feature. Let&rsquo;s start with the last one.</p>

<p><code>onStartLoading</code> contract specifies, that you should start monitoring the data source upon entering this state. But let&rsquo;s think what would happen if you had a query that takes 200ms to run and your data source would change every 150ms. The loader would never deliver any data, because every load request would be cancelled in middle of <code>loadInBackground</code> execution by our content observer.</p>

<p>I guess that&rsquo;s why the Android implementation of <code>CursorLoader</code> registers the observer after the data is loaded. This way the first results are delivered as soon as possible, but for subsequent loads the data is delivered only when data didn&rsquo;t change during loading. I&rsquo;m not sure if it was intentional, or this behavior was implemented by accident, but it makes sense to me, so let&rsquo;s adjust our Loaders contract and implement this behavior in our AbstractLoader.</p>

<p>But if you look closely, the <code>CursorLoader</code> implementation violates even this updated contract. Remember that <code>loadInBackground</code> and <code>deliverResults</code> are executed on separate threads. So what would happen if the data observer is triggered after <code>registerContentObserver</code> call, but before the <code>deliverResults</code>? We&rsquo;d get exactly the same behavior we&rsquo;d get had we registered the ContentObserver in <code>onStartLoading</code> &ndash; the loader would never deliver it&rsquo;s data. That&rsquo;s the first bug.</p>

<p>The second issue with <code>CursorLoader</code> implementation is violation of <code>onAbandon</code> callback contract. If someone calls restartLoader and the content observer is triggered, the abandoned Loader instance will happily reload it&rsquo;s data just to throw it away.</p>

<p>You can dismiss it as something that would happen only 1% of the time and has negligible impact, and if we were talking about application code, I&rsquo;d agree with you, but IMO library code that will be used by thousands of developers should be held to a higher standard.</p>

<h2>Fixing CursorLoader</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the wrap up of changes in behavior:
1. Register <code>ContentObserver</code> after the first data is delivered, not after the first data is loaded.
2. Unregister <code>ContentObserver</code> in <code>onAbandon</code>.</p>

<p>The first point requires changes to <code>deliverResult</code> method, so it makes sense to modify our AbstractLoader:</p>

<p>The second part &ndash; unregistering observer in <code>onAbandon</code> &ndash; is tricky. It&rsquo;s illegal to call <code>Cursor.unregisterContentObserver</code> with observer that wasn&rsquo;t registered and the <code>onAbandon</code> can be called when the <code>deliverResults</code> wasn&rsquo;t called (see <code>AsyncTaskLoader.dispatchOnLoadComplete()</code> implementation). One solution would be keeping the set of Cursors that were registered, but it&rsquo;s not optimal. Instead, we can create a proxy ContentObserver that can be enabled or disabled:</p>

<h2>AbstractObservingLoader</h2>

<p>The <code>CursorLoader</code> is a bit special case, because the <code>Cursor</code> itself contains <code>ContentObservable</code>. In most cases however the content observers and loaded data would be completely separated. For these cases it would be useful to have a base class for Loader which registers some <code>ContentObservers</code>:</p>

<p>We need to keep the registered state in our Loader, because the default <code>Observable</code> implementation doesn&rsquo;t like registering the same observer twice or unregistering not registered observer.</p>

<p>Now we can use this class as a base for a Loader which should be reloaded when one of specified <code>Uri</code>s is triggered:</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I think the <code>Loaders</code> aren&rsquo;t as bad as some people think and say. Four Loader states might seem complicated at first, but if you think about Android <code>Activity</code> lifecycle they make perfect sense and they are something you&rsquo;d have to implement yourself, with a high probability of mucking things up. The only thing lacking is documentation and sane base classes for extensions, something I hope I delivered through this blog post.</p>

<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/114205433913370454414">+CommonsWare</a> wrote few weeks ago that <a href="http://commonsware.com/blog/2014/03/31/cwac-loaderex-failed-abstractions.html">he considers Loader to be a failed abstraction</a>, mostly because the interface assumes there is a single object which notifies the Loader about new data. He concluded his post with the following sentence:</p>

<blockquote><p>In my case, if I am going to have some singleton manager object, with distinct data objects per operation, I am going to use something more flexible than Loader, such as an event bus.</p></blockquote>


<p>Extending <code>AbstractObservingLoader</code> to load some data from <code>SQLiteDatabase</code> and subscribe to some event bus for model change events should be trivial, and you&rsquo;d get a lot of things for free &ndash; performing loads in background, cancelling loads, caching results, invalidating cache, and so on.</p>

<p>Having said that, <code>Loaders</code> are not solution to every single problem. They are coupled with activity lifecycle, so they are not suitable for long running tasks that should not be interrupted when user navigates away. In these cases the <code>IntentService</code>, or some other <code>Service</code> implementation is a better choice.</p>

    <link href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/06/10/enabling-proguard-for-debug-builds/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-10T09:24:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/06/10/enabling-proguard-for-debug-builds</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The post title raises two questions: &ldquo;why would you want to use ProGuard in debug builds?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why the hell are you still using ant?!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The answer for the first question is simple, so let&rsquo;s start with that one. A while ago we hit the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=20814">infamous 64k method limit</a>. The most reasonable option is to use ProGuard to remove unused code, especially from the dependencies. For some unreasonable option, see the Jesse Wilson&rsquo;s comments in the linked bug report.</p>

<p>And why ant instead of Maven, gradle, buck or any other non-antique build tool? We&rsquo;ve started the project in dark ages (in 2011), when the android Maven plugin was still under heavy development and we encontered several issues with it. Ant builds just worked, so we set it up and nobody had to touch it for several months. At one point we considered switching to gradle, because setting up some annotation processors with ant was a pain in the ass, but again there were some issues with using gradle in our setup at the time (IIRC it was not possible to use local aar dependencies, and the builds were sooooooo slooooooow), so we did not switch.</p>

<p>It all boils down to this: I can spend several hours working on some useful feature or library or I can use this time to switch to another build system. Until the latter option gives me some real benefits, I&rsquo;d rather work on some features.</p>

<p>Anyways, using ProGuard for IDE builds is easy: go to Project Structure, Facets, and fill appropriate options on ProGuard tab for your project. That&rsquo;s fine for developers workflow, but not for CI.</p>

<p>To make ProGuard work with ant you need to customize your build.xml. First, if this is your first cusomization, change the version tag in build.xml as recommended:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="c">&lt;!-- version-tag: custom --&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then override <code>-debug-obfuscation-check</code> and <code>-release-obfuscation-check</code> targets:</p>

<p>Note that I&rsquo;ve also introduced a <code>-set-proguard-config</code> task to be able to select different configuration for debug and release builds. We do not want to do obfuscation or advanced optimisations in debug, a simple dead code pruning is all we need. Since ant properties are immutable, this means that you <strong>HAVE TO</strong> remove proguard.config from your ant.properties.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure when this happened, but at some point our build times skyrocketed to over 3 minutes. It&rsquo;s fine for release or CI scripts, but absolutely unnacceptable for developers workflow. Fortunately it was enough to bump the heap size for Proguard. In Android Studio go to Settings, Compiler, Android Compilers and pass <code>-Xmx1024m</code> to ProGuard VM options.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the UI patterns that improve lists usability is dividing items into sections. The section might be the first letter of the main text on the list item, date formatted and rounded in a specific way or whatever makes sense for your data.</p>

<p>From the technical point of view you can either add the header view to every list item and show and hide them as needed or create the separate view for header and regular list item and register multiple view types in your Adapter. Both options were described in details by <a href="https://plus.google.com/118417777153109946393">+Cyril Mottier</a> in excellent <a href="http://cyrilmottier.com/2011/07/05/listview-tips-tricks-2-section-your-listview/">ListView Tips &amp; Tricks #2: Sectioning Your ListView</a> blog post.</p>

<p>If you choose the second approach, you&rsquo;ll have to decide what to return from your <code>Adapter</code>&rsquo;s <code>getItem</code> and <code>getItemId</code> methods for items representing sections. If your sections are not supposed to be clickable, you might implement your <code>Adapter</code> like this:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to reproduce this error manually, especially if tapping the list item does something more than writing to logcat, but I investigated this issue, because the stack traces above appeared in crash reports on Google Analytics, so several people managed to click exactly wrong area at the wrong time.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t investigate the issue thoroughly, but it seems there must be some disparity between checking the <code>isEnabled</code> method and getting the item. If I ever dive into <code>ListView</code> code, I&rsquo;ll definitely write about it. If you want to reproduce or investigate the issue yourself, compile <a href="https://github.com/chalup/blog-unclickable-items">this project</a> and run the monkey:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So what can we do? First option is checking the <code>Adapter.isEnabled()</code> in your <code>onListItemClick</code> listener, which is yet another kind of boilerplate you have to add to your Android code, but it&rsquo;s super easy to add. The other option is going with the first sectioning approach, i.e. putting section as a part of the clickable list item, but it might not work for your use case (for example adapter with multiple item types).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I spend few days analyzing and fixing various issues of app widget in Base CRM application.</p>

<p>This part of our codebase was created over a year ago during one of our internal hackathons and was released soon after that. Most of the times it worked. Every once in a while we received a weird crash report from Google Analytics, but it never caused much trouble. Recently though we received few complaints from customers. I happened to have few hours available for bug hunting, so I took a dive.</p>

<p>The widget is really a simple todo list backed by <code>ContentProvider</code>. The code looks like it was based on the WeatherWidget from SDK samples. What can possibly go wrong?</p>

<h2>Issue #1: gazillions of threads started</h2>

<p>Take a look at the code of WeatherWidgetProvider:</p>

<p>The WeatherWidgetProvider is an <code>AppWidgetProvider</code> implementation, which extends a regular <code>BroadcastReceiver</code>. It means that for every action a new instance of WeatherWidgetProvider is created, and the current implementation spawns new thread which is never closed.</p>

<p>The sample author obviously intended to create only one worker thread &ndash; the sWorkerThread is the static &ndash; but forgot to do the null check before creating a new thread. So let&rsquo;s fix it:</p>

<h2>Issue #2: no refresh after application update</h2>

<p>The widget shows data from the same <code>ContentProvider</code> as the main app, so when the user creates a task inside in the main app and then goes back to homescreen, the task should be displayed on the widget. To achieve this we did the same thing the WeatherWidget sample does &ndash; we register the <code>ContentObserver</code> in <code>onEnabled</code> callback of <code>AppWidgetProvider</code>:</p>

<p>The <code>onEnabled</code> callback is called when the first instance of the widget is added to homescreen, so the code looks fine. Unfortunately the callback is not called at your process startup. So if your app is updated and the process is restarted, the <code>ContentObserver</code> won&rsquo;t be registered. The same thing happens if your app crashes or is stopped by the OS to free resources.</p>

<p>To solve this you have to register the <code>ContentObserver</code> in few more places. I have added registration to <code>onCreate</code> callback in <code>RemoteViewsFactory</code> and the <code>onReceive</code> part which handles our custom actions in <code>AppWidgetProvider</code>.</p>

<p>WeatherWidget sample does one more thing wrong: the <code>ContentObserver</code> is never unregistered and the worker thread is never stopped. The correct place to do this is <code>onDisabled</code> callback in <code>AppWidgetProvider</code>.</p>

<h2>Issue #3: <code>CursorOutOfBoundsException</code> crash</h2>

<p>Ever since we introduced the tasks widget, we&rsquo;ve occasionally received the crash reports indicating that the RemoteViewsFactory requested elements outside of <code>[0, getCount)</code> range:</p>

<p>The reproduction steps for this issue are quite complicated:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tap the task on the widget to mark it was completed. Internally we set the <code>PENDING_DONE</code> flag, so the task is marked as done, but is still displayed on the list, so the user can tap it again and reset the flag.</li>
<li>Trigger the sync</li>
<li><code>SyncAdapter</code> syncs the Task to our backend. The task is marked as <code>DONE</code> in our database, which triggers the <code>ContentObserver</code> registered by the widget.</li>
<li><code>ContentObserver</code> triggers <code>onDataSetChanged</code> callback in <code>RemoteViewsFactory</code>, which then calls <code>getCount</code> and <code>getViewAt</code></li>
<li>In some rare cases <code>getViewAt</code> with position == result of <code>getCount</code> is called</li>
</ul>


<p>It looks like some kind of a race condition or another threading issue in Android code which populates the app widgets. I tried synchronizing the <code>RemoteViewsFactory</code> methods, but it didn&rsquo;t help. The <code>getViewAt</code> have to return a valid <code>RemoteViews</code>, so I fixed it up by returning the loading view when element outside of valid range is requested:</p>

<h2>Issue #4: no refresh when &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep activities&rdquo; setting is enabled</h2>

<p>User can click on the tasks displayed on the widget to go to the edit screen. The activity is closed when user saves or discards changes and the homescreen with the widget is shown again. Changing the task triggers the <code>ContentObserver</code>, the <code>onDataSetChanged</code> is called on all active <code>RemoteViewsFactories</code>, but sometimes other callbacks (<code>getCount</code>, <code>getViewAt</code>, etc.) are not called.</p>

<p>It turns out this happens when the Homescreen activity is recreated because of low memory condition. To easily reproduce this issue you can check the &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep activities&rdquo; in developers settings.</p>

<p>I do not have a solution or workaround for this issue unfortunately. I&rsquo;ll file a bug report and hope for the best.</p>

<h2>Recap</h2>

<p>There are mutliple issues with the WeatherWidget sample and some issues with the system services responsible for populating app widgets with content. I&rsquo;ve created a simple project which reproduces the issues #3 and #4 and shows the correct way of registering <code>ContentObserver</code> for your widget. The sources are <a href="https://github.com/chalup/android-widget-fail">available on Github</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve pushed new versions of <a href="https://github.com/chalup/microorm">microorm</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chalup/thneed">thneed</a> to Maven Central today. The most notable change for both libraries is dropping the support for Android 2.2 and earlier versions. The same change was applied to all Android libraries open sourced by <a href="https://github.com/orgs/futuresimple/">Base</a>. Why? <a href="https://plus.google.com/104992412719307414985">+Jeff Gilfelt</a> summed it up nicely:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Because it is 2014 <a href="https://t.co/UCMaZOB6Sl">https://t.co/UCMaZOB6Sl</a></p>&mdash; Jeff Gilfelt (@readyState) <a href="https://twitter.com/readyState/statuses/435419373852184576">February 17, 2014</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>This tweet is a good laugh (and an excellent example of what happens if you limit the discussion to 140 characters), but there are poor souls who might need an answer they can use as an objective argument. For them, here is my take on this one: you should drop support for Froyo because sizeable chunk of Java 1.6 APIs were missing from API level 8. I&rsquo;m not talking about some dark corners of java packages, I&rsquo;m talking about stuff like <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String.html#isEmpty%28%29"><code>String.isEmpty()</code></a>, <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Deque.html"><code>Deque</code></a>, <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/NavigableSet.html"><code>NavigableSet</code></a>, <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/io/IOException.html"><code>IOException</code></a>&rsquo;s constructors with cause parameter, <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/api_diff/9/changes/changes-summary.html">and so on</a>.</p>

<p>Your own code can (and should) be checked with Lint, but these methods and classes can also be used by the 3rd party libraries and I&rsquo;m not aware of any static analysis tool that can help you in this case. So if your app supports Froyo and uses a lot of external dependencies, you&rsquo;re probably sitting on the <a href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2013/06/26/guava-and-minsdkversion">NoClassDefFoundError bomb</a>. It might force you to use obsolete versions of libraries, the most notable example of which is Guava &ndash; on Froyo you have to use 13.0.1, a 18 months old version.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s also the reason why the libraries authors should be the first ones to move on to Android 2.3 and later. If you use obsolete library in your application, you&rsquo;re hurting only yourself. If you use it as a library dependency, you&rsquo;re hurting every user of the library.</p>

<p>So move on and bump the minSdkVersion. After all, it&rsquo;s 2014.</p>

    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/02/20/when-do-you-absolutely-need</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/108967384991768947849/posts/i6MzCp1NyzF">Yesterdays #AndroidDev #Protip</a> explains how to use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/WakefulBroadcastReceiver.html"><code>WakefulBroadcastReceiver</code></a> utility class and what problem does it solve, but it doesn&rsquo;t mention a case when using it or manually acquiring <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.WakeLock.html"><code>WakeLock</code></a> is essential &ndash; using the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html"><code>AlarmManager</code></a>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with <code>AlarmManager</code>&rsquo;s API, here is <strong>tl;dr</strong> of the docs: it allows you to specify the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent.html"><code>PendingIntent</code></a> that should be fired at some point, even if your application is in background. The common use cases for using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html"><code>AlarmManager</code></a> is for example showing a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.html"><code>Notification</code></a> at the specified time or sending some kind of heartbeat to your backend. In both cases, your code performs potentially long running operation (in case of showing notification you might need some content from your local database), so you don&rsquo;t want to run it in the UI thread. The first thing that comes to mind is to specify an <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/IntentService.html"><code>IntentService</code></a> as a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent.html"><code>PendingIntent</code></a> target:</p>

<p>This code won&rsquo;t always work though. While it is guaranteed that the alarm will go off and the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent.html"><code>PendingIntent</code></a> will be sent, because we used a <code>_WAKEUP</code> alarm type, the device is allowed to go back to sleep before the service is started.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chalup.github.io/images/wakelock.001.png"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not explicitly documented, but both <a href="https://plus.google.com/105051985738280261832">+Dianne Hackborn</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/114205433913370454414">+CommonsWare</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/android-developers/K5ggbRigGS8/B5KajJYAae4J">confirmed</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/7444510/184953">this</a>. The workaround is to use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent.html#getBroadcast%28android.content.Context,%20int,%20android.content.Intent,%20int%29"><code>PendingIntent.getBroadcast()</code></a>, because it is guaranteed that the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html#onReceive%28android.content.Context,%20android.content.Intent%29"><code>BroadcastReceiver.onReceive()</code></a> will be always fully executed before the CPU goes to sleep. Inside that callback you have to acquire <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.WakeLock.html"><code>WakeLock</code></a> start your <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/IntentService.html"><code>IntentService</code></a> and release the lock at the end of <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/IntentService.html#onHandleIntent%28android.content.Intent%29"><code>onHandleIntent()</code></a> method.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chalup.github.io/images/wakelock.002.png"></p>

<p>This is where the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/WakefulBroadcastReceiver.html"><code>WakefulBroadcastReceiver</code></a> comes into play: its <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/WakefulBroadcastReceiver.html#startWakefulService%28android.content.Context,%20android.content.Intent%29"><code>startWakefulService</code></a> and <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/WakefulBroadcastReceiver.html#completeWakefulIntent%28android.content.Intent%29"><code>completeWakefulIntent</code></a> static methods encapsulate all the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.WakeLock.html"><code>WakeLocks</code></a> juggling, allowing you to focus on your business logic.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-25T11:43:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/01/25/offline-mode-in-android-apps-part-3-old</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2013/12/26/offline-mode-in-android-apps-part-1">first post in this series</a> explained the first consequence on implementing the offline mode &ndash; performing the data migrations. In <a href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/01/03/offline-mode-in-android-apps-part-2">second part</a> I showed a workaround for the rudimentary SQLite&rsquo;s ALTER TABLE syntax. If you have checked the link to <a href="https://github.com/futuresimple/android-schema-utils/blob/master/src/main/java/com/getbase/android/schema/MigrationsHelper.java"><code>MigrationHelper</code></a> class I mentioned, you migth have noticed that it&rsquo;s just a tiny part of a <a href="https://github.com/futuresimple/android-schema-utils">larger library</a>, which allows you to define database schemas. Note the plural &ldquo;schemas&rdquo;: the whole point of this library is defining both current schema and the schemas for the older versions of your app. This post explains why do you have to do this.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say in the first version you have the following data structure:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">firstName</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">lastName</span><span class="o">;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And the table definition for this table in your <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteOpenHelper.html"><code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code></a> looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">CREATE_TABLE_USERS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;CREATE TABLE &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">TABLE_USERS</span> <span class="o">+</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="s">&quot; ( &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">ID</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot; INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot;, &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">FIRST_NAME</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot; TEXT &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot;, &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="s">&quot; ) &quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the next version you decide to keep only the first name in a single field, so you change your data structure accordingly and perform the data migration. In the snippet below I used the <code>MigrationHelper</code>, but you might have as well performed the migration by hand:</p>

<p>The code looks fine, but you have just broken migrations from v1 to v3. If there is an user with a null email field, the app will crash in line 13 above. But why, shouldn&rsquo;t the email field in v2 schema be nullable? It should, but this migration uses the constant containing the latest schema definition with different column constraint.</p>

<p>The worst thing about this kind of bugs is that it might slip through your tests, because the crash happens only if you have a specific data before the application update.</p>

<p>You migth be tempted to define separate migrations from every old version to the latest one (in our case migrations from v1 to v3 and from v2 to v3) and always execute only single migration, but this workaround doesn&rsquo;t scale. For each new migration you&rsquo;d have to check and potentially update every existing migration. When you publish the app twice a month, this quickly becomes a huge problem.</p>

<p>The other solution is to make every migration completely independent from the others, and execute them sequentially. This way, when you define a new migration, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the previous ones. This means that when you upgrade from v1 to v3, you first upgrade from v1 to v2 and then from v2 to v2 and after the first step the database should be in the same state it were, when the v2 was the latest version. In other words, you have to keep an old database schemas.</p>

<p>As usual there are multiple ways to do this. You can copy the schema definition to another constant and append &ldquo;ver#&rdquo; suffix, but it means there will be a lot of duplicated code (although this code should never, ever change, so it&rsquo;s not as bad as the regular case of copypaste). The other way is to keep the initial database state and all the schema updates. The issue here is that you don&rsquo;t have a place in your code with current schema definition. The opposite solution is to keep the current schema and the list of downgrades. Sounds counterintuitive? Don&rsquo;t worry, that&rsquo;s because it <strong><em>is</em></strong> counterintuitive.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/futuresimple/android-schema-utils">android-schema-utils</a> I&rsquo;ve chosen the third approach, because in the long run it processes less data than the upgrades solution &ndash; in case of upgrade from vN-1 to vN it has to generate only 1 additional schema instead of N-1 schemas. I&rsquo;m still not sure if the code wouldn&rsquo;t be clearer had I went with duplicated schema definitions approach, but the current approach, once you get used to it, works fine. The schema and migrations for our example would look like this:</p>

<p>There are other benefits of keeping the old schemas in a more reasonable format than raw strings. Most of the schema migrations can be deducted from comparing subsequent schema versions, so you don&rsquo;t have to do it yourself. For example in migration from v2 to v3 I didn&rsquo;t have to specify that I want to migrate the Users table &ndash; the <code>auto()</code> migration automatically handles it. If the <code>auto()</code> is the only migration for a given upgrade, you can skip the whole <code>upgradeTo()</code> block. In our case that covered about 50% migrations, but YMMV.</p>

<p>If you go this way, your <code>onUpgrade</code> method, which usually is the most complex part of <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code>, can be reduced to this:</p>

<p>This part concludes the &ldquo;offline mode&rdquo; series. Here&rsquo;s the short recap:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t want to compromise on UX, your application should work regardless whether the user is connected to internet or not.</li>
<li>In this case the user may end up in a situation when the application is upgraded, but not all data is synced with the server yet. You <strong><em>do not</em></strong> want to lose your users&#8217; data. You&rsquo;ll have to migrate them.</li>
<li>If you migrate your data, you should keep the migrations separate from one another, because otherwise maintaining them becomes a nightmare.</li>
<li>The best way to do this that I know of, is keeping the old schemas and always performing all migrations sequentially. To make things simpler, I recommend the <a href="https://github.com/futuresimple/android-schema-utils">android-schema-utils library</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially the <code>MigrationHelper</code>&rsquo;s code looked like this:</p>

<p>It worked for a single migration, but didn&rsquo;t work for multiple migrations &ndash; the helper method for getting the column set always returned the columns of first table. Since the query was always the same, I suspected the results are cached somewhere. To verify this hypothesis I added to the temporary table name an index incremented with every migration. It worked, but then I realized I need to do the same for getting the columns of the new schema &ndash; otherwise the helper wouldn&rsquo;t work if the same table were migrated twice. This way the weird code was born.</p>

<p>But the same thing could happen outside of <code>MigrationHelper</code> operations, for example if you need to iterate through rows of the same table in two different migrations:</p>

<p>So I checked the AOSP code for the suspected cache to see how the entries can be evicted or if the cache can be disabled. There are no methods for this, so you can&rsquo;t do it with straightforward call, but maybe you can exploit the implementation details?</p>

<p>On ICS the cache is implemented as <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/LruCache.html"><code>LruCache</code></a>, so theoretically you could evict old entries by filling the cache with new ones, but there is one hiccup &ndash; you don&rsquo;t know the cache size, so you&rsquo;d always have to go with <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html#MAX_SQL_CACHE_SIZE"><code>MAX_SQL_CACHE_SIZE</code></a>.</p>

<p>Before ICS you couldn&rsquo;t do even that &ndash; the implementation of this &ldquo;cache&rdquo; is just a fixed size buffer for <code>SQLiteStatements</code>. Once that buffer is full, no more statements are cached. This also has one more consequence &ndash; your app might work much slower on Android 2.x after upgrade from old version than after fresh install, because the db cache will be filled with queries used in migrations.</p>

<p>Fortunately the keys of this cache are raw SQL strings, so we can disable cache for migration queries by adding <code>WHERE n==n</code> clause with n incremented for every query (note that you musn&rsquo;t pass n as a bound parameter &ndash; the whole point of adding this selection is to make the queries different and force <code>SQLiteDatabase</code> to compile another statement).</p>

<p>The question you should ask yourself is why do I have to know and care about all this. Isn&rsquo;t SQLite smart enough to see that I&rsquo;m trying to access the database using prepared statement compiled against old schema? It turns out the SQLite detects this issues and raises <code>SQLITE_SCHEMA</code> error (commented with &ldquo;The database schema changed&rdquo;), but Android&rsquo;s <code>SQLiteDatabase</code> wrapper drops this error and happily uses the old, invalid statements. Bad Android.</p>

    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/01/09/c-feature-i-miss-in-java-extension</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m primarily an Android developer, so when I checked the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/features">Java 8 features list</a> I thought there is a lot of cool stuff, by sadly I won&rsquo;t be able to use them anytime soon. It&rsquo;s the same case as <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/AutoCloseable.html"><code>AutoCloseable</code></a> interface from Java 7. It&rsquo;s available from API lvl 19, and seeing how long it takes Android community to unanimously drop the support for Froyo, Gingerbread and Honeycomb, I think won&rsquo;t be able to use it before 2017. Anyways, good stuff is added to Java, but there is one cool feature from C# I do not see there: extension methods.</p>

<p>Let me explain to you what they are in case you haven&rsquo;t wrote any C# code. In almost every code base there are simple utility methods which operate on a single object.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Things get ugly when you want to call multiple utility methods:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">CollectionsUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">transform</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">CollectionsUtils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">filter</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">list</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">IS_NOT_NULL</span><span class="o">),</span> <span class="n">TO_STRING</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>C# allows you to add &ldquo;this&rdquo; modifier to the first parameter of static method, which basically tells the compiler to pretend that the objects of that type have a method with the same signature as our static method, sans the &ldquo;this&rdquo; parameter. Underneath it&rsquo;s treated exactly as the ugly nested calls above, but it allows you to write the code this way:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">list</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">filter</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">IS_NOT_NULL</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">transform</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">TO_STRING</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Syntactic sugar, but it goes a long way. I&rsquo;ve intentionally choose the methods for this examples &ndash; whole LINQ-to-objects interface is based on extension methods.</p>

<p>Java 8 introduces a feature with similar name but completely different functionality: virtual extension methods. Simply put it allows merging the Foo interface and AbstractFoo abstract class with a reasonable implementation of some of Foo&rsquo;s methods. For example if your interface has <code>size()</code> method you can add the <code>isEmpty()</code> virtual extension method with default implementation returning true when <code>size()</code> returns 0. So it&rsquo;s a nice feature, but IMO less powerful than C# solution. Both solutions allow adding new methods with default implementation to interfaces you wrote without having to worry about backwards compatibility, but C# extension methods allows you also to extend 3rd party or even <code>java.lang</code> intefaces and classes to make their API cleaner or better suited to your particular problem.</p>

<p>I wonder why the C#-style extension methods weren&rsquo;t added to Java 8. Maybe there are some implementation issues I do not see, maybe there is a conflict with another language features, maybe the powers that be think it would be inconsistent with the language philosophy. Do let me know if you have such information.</p>

    <link href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/01/03/offline-mode-in-android-apps-part-2/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-03T20:29:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/01/03/offline-mode-in-android-apps-part-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2013/12/26/offline-mode-in-android-apps-part-1">first part of this series</a> I showed that to implement offline mode in your Android app you have to implement data migrations. If you&rsquo;re using SQLite database, it means you&rsquo;ll have to use (or rather work around) it&rsquo;s ALTER TABLE syntax:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/images/syntax/alter-table-stmt.gif"><img class="center" src="http://www.sqlite.org/images/syntax/alter-table-stmt.gif"></a></p>

<p>So all you can do with it is adding the column or renaming the table, but in reality you probably need to alter a single column, remove column or change the table constraints. You can achieve this by doing the following operation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rename the table T with old schema to old_T.</li>
<li>Create the table T with new schema.</li>
<li>Use &ldquo;INSERT INTO T (new_columns) SELECT old_columns FROM old_T&rdquo; query to populate the table T with the data from the renamed table old_T.</li>
<li>Drop old_T.</li>
</ol>


<p>Doing it manually is quite error prone though: for every migration you have to specify the new_columns and old_columns list. What&rsquo;s worse, in 95% of cases you just want to list the columns common for old and new schema. Fortunately we can automate such trivial migrations by executing <code>SELECT</code> with <code>LIMIT 0</code> (or <code>PRAGMA TABLE_INFO</code>) for both tables, getting the columns set using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/Cursor.html#getColumnNames%28%29"><code>Cursor.getColumnNames()</code></a>, and calculating these columns sets intersection.</p>

<p>You can write a nice wrapper for this yourself, but a) I already did it, so you don&rsquo;t have to and b) there is a <a href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/01/12/android-sqlitedatabase-gotcha">very nasty gotcha</a> which would probably cost you few hours of teeth grinding, so do yourself a favor and check <a href="https://github.com/futuresimple/android-schema-utils">this repository</a> out, especially the <a href="https://github.com/futuresimple/android-schema-utils/blob/master/src/main/java/com/getbase/android/schema/MigrationsHelper.java"><code>MigrationsHelper</code></a> class. It automates the trivial migrations and allows you to define a mappings for situations when you rename the column or add a non-nullable column in new schema.</p>

<p>In the next two posts I&rsquo;ll <a href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/01/12/android-sqlitedatabase-gotcha">describe the gotcha I&rsquo;ve mentioned</a> in the previous paragraph and show some other non-obvious consequences of doing data migrations.</p>

    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/01/03/2013-summary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One year ago <a href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2012/12/30/2012-summary">I set myself few goals for 2013</a>. Let&rsquo;s take a look how it went:</p>

<ol>
<li>I gave <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/chalup/data-model-on-android">two</a> <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/chalup/offline-mode-in-android-apps">talks</a>.</li>
<li>My blog was viewed over 13k times.</li>
<li>I have <a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/387592">published another game</a> on <a href="http://store.ovi.com/publisher/Jerzy%20Chalupski/">Nokia Store</a>.</li>
<li>I <a href="https://github.com/chalup/microorm">have</a> <a href="https://github.com/chalup/thneed">authored</a> <a href="https://github.com/futuresimple/forger">or</a> <a href="https://github.com/futuresimple/android-db-commons">contributed</a> to <a href="https://github.com/futuresimple/android-autoindexer">several</a> <a href="https://github.com/futuresimple/android-schema-utils">open</a> <a href="https://github.com/futuresimple/sqlitemaster">source</a> <a href="https://github.com/chalup/cerberus">projects</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p>Meeting two out of three goals and some open source bonus ain&rsquo;t that bad. The gloating part is done, let&rsquo;s move to the wishful thinking part, a.k.a. goals for 2014:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Keep giving the talks</strong>. I find that preparing the presentation forces me to do thorough investigation of the topic, question all my assumptions and prepare answers for potential questions. This is probably the best way to learn about something, and as a bonus you&rsquo;re sharing that knowledge afterwards.</li>
<li>Blog more. This year for each post I wrote I have added at least one more topic to my blog todo list. The resolution for this year is clearing this backlog and generating at least <strong>25k views</strong>. BTW: when I started this blog I feared that I won&rsquo;t have enough content to write regularly. Bollocks.</li>
<li>Publish at least <strong>one app on Google Play</strong>.</li>
<li>Keep working on the libraries I have published this year. It might not be a perfect metric of how useful to others my work turns out to be, but I&rsquo;d like to accumulate <strong>200 Github stars total</strong> on the projects I authored or co-authored.</li>
</ol>


<p>The only thing left to be done is to wish you a happy New Year!</p>

On one hand, in <a href="https://github.com/chalup/cerberus">Cerberus</a> I used a tiny subset of Guava features which can be trivially rewritten in vanilla Java in 15 minutes, so maybe I should not force Guava down peoples throat?  On the other hand I&rsquo;m a <a href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2013/09/21/guava-goodies">huge</a> <a href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2013/10/04/more-guava-goodies-abstractiterator">fan</a> of Guava and I think you should definitely use it in anything more complicated than &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo; tutorial, because it either reduces a boilerplate or replaces your handrolled utilities with better, faster and more thoroughly tested implementations.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;this library bloats my apk&rdquo; argument is moot, because you can easily set up the ProGuard configuration which only strips the unused code, without doing any expensive optimizations. It&rsquo;s a good idea, because the dex input will be smaller, which speeds up the build and the apk will be smaller, which reduces time required to upload and install the app on the device.</p>

<p>I found the problem though, which is a bit harder to solve. Modern versions of Guava use some <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/NavigableSet.html">Java 1.6 APIs, which are available from API level 9</a>, so when you try to use it on Android 2.2 (API level 8), you&rsquo;ll get the <code>NoSuchMethodException</code> or some other unpleasant runtime error (side note: position #233 on my TODO list was a jar analyzer which finds this problem). <a href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2013/06/26/guava-and-minsdkversion">On Android 2.2 you&rsquo;re stuck with Guava 13.0.1.</a></p>

<p>This extends also to Guava as a library dependency. If one library supports Android 2.2 and older, it forces old version of Guava as dependency. And if another library depends on more recent version of Guava, you&rsquo;re basically screwed.</p>

<p>One conclusion you can draw from this blog post is that you shouldn&rsquo;t use Guava in your open source libraries to prevent dependency hell, but that&rsquo;s spilling the baby with the bathwater. The problem is not Guava or any other library, the problem are Java 1.6 methods missing from Android API level 8! <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">The statistics from Google</a> indicates that Froyo is used by 1.6%, in case of Base CRM user base it&rsquo;s only 0.2%. So more reasonable course of action is finally <strong>bumping minSdkVersion to 10</strong> (<a href="http://dannyroa.com/2013/10/17/why-its-time-to-support-only-android-4-0-and-above/">or even 14</a>), both for your applications and all the libraries.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year I gave a talk on <a href="http://www.krakdroid.pl/">Krakdroid</a> conference about offline mode in Android apps. By offline mode I mean implementing the app such way that the network availability is completely transparent to the end users. The high level implementation idea is to decouple the operations changing the data from sending these changes through unreliable network by saving the changes in local database and sending them at convinient moment. We have encountered two major problems when we implemented this behavior in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.futuresimple.base">Base CRM</a>: data migrations and identifying entities. This blog post describes the first issue.
It might not be obvious why do you need the data migrations, so let&rsquo;s clear this out. Let&rsquo;s say on your mobile you have some data synced with backend (green squares on left and right) and some unsynced data created locally on mobile (red squares on the left).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chalup.github.io/images/unsynced.png"></p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s say that we introduce new functionality to our app, which changes the schema of our data models (the squares on the backend side are changed to circles).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chalup.github.io/images/schemachange.png"></p>

<p>The schema of the local database have to be changed as well. The naive way of handling this situation is dropping old database with old schema, creating new one with new schema and resyncing all the data from backend, but there are two issues with this approach: if there is a lot of data the resyncing might take a while, which negates the most important advantage of offline mode &ndash; that the app is fully functional all the time.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chalup.github.io/images/lotofdata.png"></p>

<p>More serious issue is that dropping the old database means that the unsynced data will be dropped along with it.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://chalup.github.io/images/unsynceddata.png"></p>

<p>The only way to provide the optimal user experience is to perform schema migrations locally for both synced and unsynced data:</p>

<p>Migrating the data doesn&rsquo;t sound like a challenging thing to code, but the combination of obscure SQLite and Android issues complicates the matter. Without proper tools it&rsquo;s quite easy to make your code unmaintainable in the long run. I&rsquo;ll describe this issues and our solutions in the further posts.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of the December I had an opportunity to gave a talk on a <a href="http://www.krakdroid.pl/">Krakdroid conference</a>. The organizers outdid themselves this year, the venue, other speakers and the overall event atmosphere was amazing. Definitely a place to be at if you&rsquo;re in Krakow at the end of the year.</p>

<p>This year I talked about the offline mode in Android apps. The talk was 30% sales pitch, 10% shameless plug and 60% describing the pitfalls one can fall into when implementing offline mode. I&rsquo;m going to describe two major problems with offline mode in details on my blog and here are the slides:</p>

<p><script async="" class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="6b523f1041750131528c42d974972a8f" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"/></p>

<p>Protip on giving a public speech &ndash; take a sip of water every 2-3 slides, especially if you&rsquo;re not feeling well and you have a sore throat.</p>

<p>I got an atrocious headache in the afternoon and went home, so I didn&rsquo;t see all the talks, but I&rsquo;ve seen the rare thing &ndash; a succesful live coding &ndash; by <a href="http://plus.google.com/101390418023034694144">+Wojtek Erbetowski</a> who presented the <a href="https://github.com/Polidea/RoboSpock">RoboSpock</a> testing framework and incrementally turned a meh-Java code into concise Groove goodness. <a href="http://plus.google.com/102636096187402339072">+Maciej Górski</a> did the maps framework overview, and although he&rsquo;s the author of excellent <a href="https://github.com/mg6maciej/android-maps-extensions">Android Maps Extensions</a> he managed to be surprisingly objective. The first talk by <a href="http://plus.google.com/106250762035158784863">+Wojtek Kaliciński</a> triggered an internal discussion and Base about reducing the support for old Android versions. It won&rsquo;t happen overnight, but at least we&rsquo;ve moved from the dangerous &ldquo;c'mon, it&rsquo;s not that hard to support Froyo&rdquo; mindtrack. I&rsquo;ll definitely write more about this.</p>

<p>To summarise, it was a great event. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot, I&rsquo;ve met some interesting people and I gave another talk, which completes <a href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2012/12/30/2012-summary">one of the goals I set myself up for 2013</a>. Good stuff.</p>
