I've uploaded my two experimental projects, [MicroOrm](https://github.com/chalup/microorm) and [Thneed](https://github.com/chalup/thneed), to [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Corg.chalup). If you want to try them out, just add the following lines to your pom.xml:

``` xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.chalup.thneed</groupId>
  <artifactId>thneed</artifactId>
  <version>0.3</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.chalup.microorm</groupId>
  <artifactId>microorm</artifactId>
  <version>0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

Don't hesitate to [`email me`](mailto:jerzy.chalupski@gmail.com), create an issue on github or propose a pull request. Any form of feedback is welcome!
