Today I have finally pushed both versions of Word Judge through Nokia Store QA. The version with an english dictionary was available for over the week now, but I had to submit the polish version few times until it passed the Nokia tests.

Anyways, the applications are available for free in Nokia Store. Here's the link for [english version](http://store.ovi.com/content/262526) and [polish version](http://store.ovi.com/content/262535) (might not be available in all countries - I had to add some restrictions to pass QA process).

Stay tuned for posts about development of Symbian version and enjoy your Scrabble games.
