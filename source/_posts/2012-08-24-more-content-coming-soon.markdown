It's been a while since my last blog post. The main reason of this unfortunate state is the fact that I've changed my day job. I've dumped my cushy corporate post in favor of more demanding position at startup. I have much less time for blogging and my personal projects, but in return I've learned a **lot** about Android. I already have about two dozens entries on my topic list and I keep adding new ones every other day.

The "write when you have some time" plan obviously doesn't work, so I have to try something else. My current plan is "publish one post every Wednesday". We'll see soon how will it work out for me.
