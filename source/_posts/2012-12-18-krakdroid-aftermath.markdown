I finally got some sleep after a really busy weekend. For the first time I had an opportunity to give a talk at the programming related conference. I was also responsible for a programming contest organized by the company I work at, I tried to push the new release of our product and, on top of that, I had to do some Christmas related stuff, so I didn't get much sleep.

Let's get back to the programming. I gave the talk about standard synchronization pattern on Android (`SyncAdapter` + `Authenticator` + `ContentProvider`) during this year's edition of KrakDroid conference. Here are the slides:

The link to recorded video can be found in the slideshare content description. I won't bother posting it here, because a) I gave the talk in Polish, and I try to keep the content of this blog in English b) I was really tired, at one point of the talk I had to stop and ask myself "What the hell am I trying to say".

Although my talk was average and there are many things I might have done better, I'm very happy I had an opportunity to give this talk. Public speaking is definitely outside of my comfort zone and I learned a lot. Here's the "conference speaker checklist" for my future self:

1. Get some sleep
1. Do the test run of the talk in front of the mirror

    I finished the slides for my presentation half an hour before giving it, so I didn't have a chance to rehearse it. There were few points during my talk when adding a slide with a summary would make things much clearer. Which brings me to the next point:

1. Recap

    I'm not sure how much the listeners who didn't knew anything about sync will remember from my talk. The recaps could help them remember at least some keywords they would be able to google later.

1. Do the test run of the talk in front of other people

    But not any other people - you want your audience to be critical and at least a bit familiar with the topic. You want someone who will tell you that this part of the talk is boring or that part is not clear.

1. Get more sleep

And finally, do not freak out - the hardest part is saying "Hello, my name is...", the rest will pour out of you.
