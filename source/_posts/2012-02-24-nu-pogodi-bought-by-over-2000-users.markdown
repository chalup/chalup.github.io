This week my ["Nu, Pogodi!"](http://store.ovi.com/content/219800) game reached the 2000 downloads from Nokia Store. It might not be a lot if you compare it to the number of Angry Birds downloads, but considering that a) the game is paid, i.e. those 2000 Nokia phone users actually spent their money on my game, and b) it took about two weeks total to program it, I think it's a very good result.

Despite the fact that the game is very simple, [I've learned](/blog/2012/01/22/how-not-to-test-your-qml-application) [a lot](/blog/2012/01/31/updating-qt-applications-in-nokia-store/) [while writing](/blog/2012/02/01/handling-qml-errors-101) [and publishing it](/blog/2012/02/23/nokia-belle-update-and-content), which makes me very excited about the next, more complex programs I'm going to release and gives me enormous motivation boost. Now I just need to get to keep working before it wears off.
