    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/09/10/contentprovider-series-introduction</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the first section of Android <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html">API Guides</a> is the description of different app compontents. New developers can read about Activities, which map directly to app UI, about Services, which perform background tasks, about BroadcastReceivers, which let&rsquo;s your app react to different system events, etc. At some point they read about ContentProvider and they think:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Why would I want to use it?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Android documentation give two reasons: when you want to share data with other applications; or when you want to integrate with search framework. I&rsquo;d say these use cases do not apply to most of the Android applications out there, but there are other resasons for using ContentProviders.</p>

<h2>Database handle management</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you don&rsquo;t use ContentProvider, but you want to use the SQLite database to store your data. Most likely you&rsquo;ll end up with the <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code> singleton in your <code>Application</code> object with some helper methods. Easy to code, but it&rsquo;s really reimplementation of <code>Context.getContentResolver()</code>.</p>

<h2>Encapsulation</h2>

<p>If you go with the solution described above, you&rsquo;ll operate directly on the <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code> or <code>SQLiteDatabase</code> objects and if you&rsquo;re not careful, this implementation detail will leak across your application. Ideally you should create an abstraction around it, but then you&rsquo;ll end up with something like ContentProvider anyways.</p>

<h2>When in Rome, do as the Romans do</h2>

<p>The ContentProvider API is leaked throughout the Android SDK. Whether it&rsquo;s good or bad thing is a topic for another blog post, but the facts stay the same. If you decide not to use the ContentProvider, you forego publish-subscribe mechanism provided by <code>CursorLoaders</code> (<strong>tl;dr:</strong> you can set up automatic reload of data on the UI when the data is updated), <code>SyncAdapter</code> framework with built-in throttling, etc. You can implement all of this on your own, but you probably should focus on your business logic and UX instead of rewriting Android SDK.</p>

<h2>IPC</h2>

<p>As in &ldquo;Inter-process communication&rdquo;. I haven&rsquo;t seen this point raised in any ContentProvider discussions, but the ContentProvider can be moved to separate process (if you don&rsquo;t do some smelly things like accessing singletons) or accessed from any other processes in your application. And why would you want to do this?</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t do some brain-dead stupid things, the biggest source of animation jank in your application is garbage collection pauses. This problem is partially solved by GC improvements in ART in Android L, but let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; I don&rsquo;t expect will be <code>minSdkVersion=20</code> before the end of 2016. Until then we need another solution.</p>

<p>Since GC is performed per-process, one thing you can do is moving your memory intensive operations &ndash; like web API access and JSON parsing &ndash; to another process. But if you want to access your database from another process you can&rsquo;t use <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code> singleton. You&rsquo;ll have to access it through some IPC mechanism. ContentProvider gives you this for free.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>There are more to ContentProviders than you can see in the official documentation or top 5 hits on Google search. Actually, this is the first post in the upcoming series of posts in which I&rsquo;ll describe some other aspects of ContentProvider implementation like content Uris design, thread safety, ContentProvider API deficiencies, documentation samples suckage and some solutions that can make implementing ContentProviders less painful. Stay tuned!</p>

    <link href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/09/04/my-shortest-lived-project-ever/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-04T21:11:06+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/09/04/my-shortest-lived-project-ever</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three weeks ago I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/chalup/proguard-please">proguard-please</a> plugin. I was super excited by this project because:</p>

<ol>
<li>It was a Gradle plugin, something I wanted to play with for quite some time</li>
<li>It was written in Groovy, a language I wanted to play with for quite some time</li>
<li>It solved a real issue with ProGuard configuration, which was pissing me off for quite some time</li>
</ol>


<h2>On configuring ProGuard</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with ProGuard, here&rsquo;s the basic info: it&rsquo;s a program which prunes the unused code from your compiled Java program. It can also do other stuff like optimization or code obfuscation and repackaging to make the reverse engineering harder. Sounds good? The catch is that ProGuard sometimes cuts out or obfuscates too much code, which usually breaks the app, especially if you rely on reflection. The trick is to configure it correctly for each library you use, but it&rsquo;s not a trivial task.</p>

<p>The general idea for this plugin was to resolve the dependencies of your Android application and try to find the ProGuard configuration for every one of them. Of course the ProGuard config will not magically appear: the idea was to have a repository of configurations developed by the community.</p>

<h2>On Gradle</h2>

<p>First part of the project went really smooth, thanks to the <a href="http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/userguide.html">amazing documentation</a>. I didn&rsquo;t need to do any fancy stuff, so I was able to configure the basic scaffolding in no time at all. Docs for android gradle plugin are pretty much non-existent, but using the imported sources and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/hvisser/android-apt">android-apt</a> plugin by <a href="https://twitter.com/botteaap">Hugo Visser</a> as a base for Android related tasks I was able to get my plugin up and running.</p>

<h2>On Groovy</h2>

<p>I saw the Groovy for the first time at KrakDroid conference, when <a href="https://github.com/wojtekerbetowski">Wojciech Erbetowski</a> converted boring JUnit tests into <a href="https://github.com/Polidea/RoboSpock">RoboSpock</a> goodness. It looked nice, but when I started coding in Groovy, my love for this language faded.</p>

<p>There are lot of things I take for granted as a Java developer: amazing IDE, instant feedback when I screw something up and documentation for the code under my cursor at my fingertips. Maybe switching to Groovy, Ruby or Python requires some mindset change I haven&rsquo;t fully embraced, but I simply cannot imagine why would I switch to the language that effectively forces me to write my code in Notepad™.</p>

<p>I think the main problem I have with Groovy stems for the fact that there are some APIs that wouldn&rsquo;t typecheck in regular Java. Consider this code:</p>

<p>```groovy
if (!project.android[&ldquo;productFlavors&rdquo;].isEmpty()) {</p>

<pre><code>throw new ProjectConfigurationException("The build flavors are not supported yet", null)
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>def obfuscatedVariants = project.android[&ldquo;applicationVariants&rdquo;].findAll { v &ndash;> v.obfuscation != null }
```</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a classic type of what I call &ldquo;string typing&rdquo;: depending on the key used in <code>project.android[]</code> access you get collection of objects of completely different type. As a consequence, the IDE cannot provide you with autocompletion or documentation for the collection contents.</p>

<p>Another example is the public API of Grgit library. Theoretically you can call <code>Grgit.clone(...)</code>, but there is no such method as <code>clone</code> in <code>Grgit</code> class, instead you have this code:</p>

<p>```groovy
class Grgit {</p>

<pre><code>private static final Map STATIC_OPERATIONS = [init: InitOp, clone: CloneOp]

static {
    Grgit.metaClass.static.methodMissing = { name, args -&gt;
        OpSyntaxUtil.tryOp(Grgit, STATIC_OPERATIONS, [] as Object[], name, args)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>} <br/>
```</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s wrong with the good ol' static method and what do you achieve by using <code>methodMissing</code> (besides confusing the IDE and breaking autocomplete/javadocs). Maybe I&rsquo;m just grupy old fart with brain eroded by too long exposure to Java, but Groovy is definitely not a language for me. I&rsquo;ll put up with it if I ever want to write another gradle plugin, but it&rsquo;s not going to be my go to language.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s up with the blog title?</h2>

<p>Few hours after publishing my project, another solution for ProGuard configuration appeared. It turns out, if you use gradle to build your library, you can configure <code>consumerProguardFiles</code> property to include in your aar package a ProGuard configuration that should be used by the users of your library. The logical next step is creating the library project containing only the ProGuard configuration for the most popular libraries out there. And that&rsquo;s exactly what <a href="https://bitbucket.org/littlerobots/squadleader">squadleader</a> project is.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as flexible solution as my <a href="https://github.com/chalup/proguard-please">proguard-please</a> plugin, but it&rsquo;s much simpler, much easier to contribute to and the net effect is the same. In this light I chose to put my project on hold and redirect developers to squadleader page.</p>

<p>Despite of that, I&rsquo;m glad I worked on this project. I&rsquo;m very excited by the fact that you can easily build an useful tool that&rsquo;s incredibly easy to use. Using gradle for a new build system was a great call.</p>

    <link href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/07/03/android-recent-apps-list-and-intent-extras/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-03T22:14:06+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/07/03/android-recent-apps-list-and-intent-extras</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re programming for the same platform for some time, you have probably developed some habits. You do some stuff in a particular way, because you&rsquo;ve always done it this way. It might be a good thing if you know all pros and cons of your solution, because your code will be consistent and you don&rsquo;t waste time rethinking the same things over and over again. On the other hand it is a good practice to question this established ways of doing things from time to time &ndash; maybe you&rsquo;ve missed something when you thought about this last time or some of your arguments are no longer valid.</p>

<p>For me one of such things was the <code>Serializable</code> vs. <code>Parcelable</code> conundrum. A long time ago I read somewhere that <code>Serializable</code> is much slower than <code>Parcelable</code> and it shouldn&rsquo;t be used for large objects, but it&rsquo;s fast enough for passing simple POJOs between <code>Fragments</code> and <code>Activities</code> with <code>Intent</code> or arguments <code>Bundle</code>. While this is still a generally good advice, I realized I don&rsquo;t know how much faster the <code>Parcelable</code> is. Are we looking at 10µs vs. 15µs or 10µs vs. 10ms?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m too lazy to write a benchmark myself, but I found a <a href="http://www.developerphil.com/parcelable-vs-serializable/">decent article</a>. Tl;dr: on modern hardware (Nexus 4) serializing a simple data structure takes about 2ms and using <code>Parcelable</code> is about 10 times faster.</p>

<p>Another hit on Google was a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1daiib/parcelable_vs_serializable/">reddit thread</a> for this article. I found there an interesting comment by <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/+JakeWharton">+Jake Wharton</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Serializable is like a tattoo. You are committing to a class name, package, and field structure forever. The only way to &ldquo;remove&rdquo; it is epic deserialization hacks.</p></p><p><p>Yes using it in an Intent isn&rsquo;t much harm, but if you use serialization there&rsquo;s a potential for crashing your app. They upgrade, hit your icon on the launcher, and Android tries to restore the previous Intent for where they were at in your app. You changed the object so deserialization fails and the app crashes. Not a good upgrade experience. Granted this is rare, but if you ever persist something to disk like this it can leave you in an extremely bad place.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>There are two inaccuracies in the comment above. First, the problem will happen only if the app is started from the recet apps list, not from the launcher icon. Second, the problem is not limited to <code>Serializable</code> extras: <code>Parcelable</code> might read the byte stream originally written from a different structure (in this situation crash is a best case scenario), some extras might be missing, some might hold wrong type of data.</p>

<p>Can you prevent this issue? I don&rsquo;t think so, at least not without some sophisticated validation of Intent extras. Considering that this issue is very rare and it goes away after starting the faulty app from somewhere else than recent apps list I don&rsquo;t think you should spend any time trying to fix it, but it&rsquo;s good to know about it, as it might explain some WTF crash reports coming your way.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Google I/O 2014 Summary]]></title>
    <link href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/06/27/google-i-slash-o-2014-summary/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-27T21:34:11+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/06/27/google-i-slash-o-2014-summary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are my thoughts after watching the keynote and few Android related sessions.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<h3>Android One</h3>

<p>This might be a huge, not only because it means expanding the potential user base for your apps. The most important thing is that all these new devices will run the latest Android and software updates will be provided by Google. If this kind of support becomes standard, we might be able to use <code>minSdkVersion=20</code> pretty soon.</p>

<h3>ART</h3>

<p>The Dalvik was decomissioned, the new runtime is the only runtime. I do hope this means that the 64k method limit is no longer a problem and there are no technical roadblocks for Java 8 support. Maybe this questions were answersed during <a href="https://www.google.com/events/io/schedule/session/b750c8da-aebe-e311-b297-00155d5066d7">The ART runtime</a> session, unfortunately there was no live stream of it.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: the video from the session is available. The GC improvements and performance boosts are amazing, but if I understand everything correctly the ART still uses dex bytecode underneath, so all Dalvik limitations are still in place.   Bad Google.</p>

<h3><a href="https://plus.google.com/+XavierDucrohet/posts">+Xavier Ducrohet</a></h3>

<p>I got the feeling that he&rsquo;s the only Google employee who acknowledges that there are serious issues with developing on Android. Great answers about unit tests and robolectric support, good answer about Scala support.</p>

<h2>Dunno what to make of it</h2>

<h3>RecyclerView</h3>

<p><code>ListViews</code> are far from perfect. I know, because in our codebase we have few workarounds for the issues or poor APIs. It&rsquo;s good that something more flexible is available, it&rsquo;s great that it&rsquo;s a part of support library, but some parts of the <code>RecyclerView</code> API look incredibly complex.</p>

<h3>Unlock bypass with Wear device</h3>

<p>Call me paranoid, but this feature means that if I get mugged, I&rsquo;m totally screwed. Someone gets access to my email, and through that he gets access to every piece of my data on the web and my digital idendity. Thanks, I&rsquo;ll pass.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are users who do not use pin or pattern on the lockscreens. For these people, this feature is a significant security improvement.</p>

<h2>Lowlights</h2>

<h3>Always running, big-ass TVs</h3>

<p>During keynote one speaker mentioned that in average household the TV is on for 5 hours every day and suggested that for the other 19 hours it can be used as a digital canvas for your content. I&rsquo;m not sure if encouraging people to keep the huge, power hungry device all the time to display nice pictures is very thoughtful and enviromentally aware.</p>

<h3>Fireside chat</h3>

<p>There were some über lame questions from the audience, but that&rsquo;s expected when questions are not moderated. However there were also über lame answers for valid questions, and there is no excuse for it.</p>

<p>The very first question, about Java 8 support, was answered with smirks and a slimy answer from Chet Haase. Dear Google, after WWDC the Java 8 support is no longer a huge news, so if you&rsquo;re saving it for the future, don&rsquo;t bother. And if there are any issues with Java 8 support &ndash; legal, technical, whatever &ndash; just let the developers know.</p>

    <link href="http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/06/15/minsdkversion-equals-15/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-15T09:29:50+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://chalup.github.io/blog/2014/06/15/minsdkversion-equals-15</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago <a href="https://twitter.com/readyState">Jeff Gilfelt</a> was giving away <code>minSdkVersion=14</code> stickers, promoting the idea of dumping the support for Gingerbread and Honeycomb. What seemed radical one year ago, today is a widely accepted. The <code>minSdkVersion</code> in new project wizard in latest Android Studio release is by default set to <code>15</code>. On the same screen you can click the &ldquo;help me choose&rdquo; hyperlink, which shows this screen:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/android_studio_min_sdk.png"></p>

<p>The percentages are consistent with data from <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">developer.android.com</a> dashboards, but I&rsquo;d say they are skewed towards old Android versions. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.futuresimple.base">Base CRM</a> app I&rsquo;m working on has only 3.7% active users on devices with api level &lt; 15 (compared to 17.4% from official Google dashboards). Moreover, if you look only at the new users, the Froyo, GingerBread and Honeycomb is used only by 1%. In this light, supporting pre-API15 devices is a criminal waste, and starting new projects with minSdkVersion lower than 15 a criminal idiocy.</p>

<p>For me, as a delevoper, the <code>minSdkVersion=14</code> is a breakthrough, mostly because of Holo theme available everywhere. I no longer have to worry about <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2012/03/08/customizing-ui-controls-on-android/">HTC rounded green buttons and such when creating custom views</a> &ndash; I only have to make them look good with a single theme. Theoretically one could have used <a href="https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere">HoloEverywhere lib</a>, but it&rsquo;s not a drop-in replacement. First you have to switch to using their Views instead of native ones and adjusting any external UI library to use them as well.</p>

<p>I looked through the <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/index.html">Android changelogs</a> wondering what could be the next version on <code>minSdkVersion</code> stickers. The next step is a small bump to JellyBean (API level 16), which gives us access to actions in system notifications and <code>condensed</code> and <code>light</code> Roboto font variants. Official statictics state that Ice Cream Sandwich is used by 12.3% of users, but this number is much higher than the one from Base statistics &ndash; 5.87%. I expect dropping support for ICS this year.</p>

<p>But then? I don&rsquo;t see anything as groundbreaking as dropping Gingerbread. I don&rsquo;t even see anything with more impact than dropping ICS. Theoretically API level 17 gives access to nested fragments, but I think you should be using support-v4 classes anyways (and if you check the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.samples.apps.iosched">Google I/O 2014</a> app sources, Google developers seem to think so too). Maybe there&rsquo;s something I missed or something crucial for specific use cases &ndash; do let me know if there&rsquo;s anything in API levels 17-19 you wish you could use already.</p>

<p>Google I/O is coming though, and <a href="https://twitter.com/GabMarioPower/status/477040313832583168">some things indicate</a> we might see Android 5.0 (or at least Android 4.5). Maybe this Android &ldquo;L&rdquo; version will be another breakthrough in development? My personal wish is a new runtime without <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=20814">ridiculous 64k method limit</a>. Of course this opens a lot of other possibilities. Maybe support for Java 8? Or first-class support for other JVM languages? We&rsquo;ll see&hellip;</p>
