    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of the December I had an opportunity to gave a talk on a <a href="http://www.krakdroid.pl/">Krakdroid conference</a>. The organizers outdid themselves this year, the venue, other speakers and the overall event atmosphere was amazing. Definitely a place to be at if you&rsquo;re in Krakow at the end of the year.</p>

<p>This year I talked about the offline mode in Android apps. The talk was 30% sales pitch, 10% shameless plug and 60% describing the pitfalls one can fall into when implementing offline mode. I&rsquo;m going to describe two major problems with offline mode in details on my blog and here are the slides:</p>

<p><script async="" class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="6b523f1041750131528c42d974972a8f" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"/></p>

<p>Protip on giving a public speech &ndash; take a sip of water every 2-3 slides, especially if you&rsquo;re not feeling well and you have a sore throat.</p>

<p>I got an atrocious headache in the afternoon and went home, so I didn&rsquo;t see all the talks, but I&rsquo;ve seen the rare thing &ndash; a succesful live coding &ndash; by <a href="http://plus.google.com/101390418023034694144">+Wojtek Erbetowski</a> who presented the <a href="https://github.com/Polidea/RoboSpock">RoboSpock</a> testing framework and incrementally turned a meh-Java code into concise Groove goodness. <a href="http://plus.google.com/102636096187402339072">+Maciej Górski</a> did the maps framework overview, and although he&rsquo;s the author of excellent <a href="https://github.com/mg6maciej/android-maps-extensions">Android Maps Extensions</a> he managed to be surprisingly objective. The first talk by <a href="http://plus.google.com/106250762035158784863">+Wojtek Kaliciński</a> triggered an internal discussion and Base about reducing the support for old Android versions. It won&rsquo;t happen overnight, but at least we&rsquo;ve moved from the dangerous &ldquo;c'mon, it&rsquo;s not that hard to support Froyo&rdquo; mindtrack. I&rsquo;ll definitely write more about this.</p>

<p>To summarise, it was a great event. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot, I&rsquo;ve met some interesting people and I gave another talk, which completes <a href="/blog/2012/12/30/2012-summary">one of the goals I set myself up for 2013</a>. Good stuff.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I gave the talk at the Mobilization 2013 conference this weekend. I have presented few libraries created at <a href="https://getbase.com/">Base CRM</a> to make the data model maintainable. Here are the slides:</p>

<script async="" class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="c08beea021d4013102be12272eac3e5b" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>


<p>Besides giving the talk, I have attended few other very interesting talks: <a href="http://plus.google.com/101390418023034694144">+Wojtek Erbetowski</a> has shown the way they test Android apps at Polidea using <a href="https://github.com/Polidea/RoboSpock">RoboSpock</a>; <a href="http://plus.google.com/110384974108475906298">+Mateusz Grzechociński</a> introduced Android devs to new build system and shared an awesome gradle protip: use &mdash;daemon command line parameter to shave off few seconds from gradle startup. <a href="http://plus.google.com/108555637824110226040">+Mateusz Herych</a> described the <a href="https://github.com/square/dagger">Dagger</a> basics and warned about few pitfalls. Mieszko Lassota described some UI blunders not only from the programming world. Finally, Krzysztof Kocel and Paweł Urban summarised the security pitfalls.</p>

<p>All in all, this years Mobilization conference was a great place to be at. See you there next year!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ll give the presentation on this years Mobiliztion conference in Łódź on October 26th:</p>

<p><a href="http://2013.mobilization.pl/"><img class="center" src="http://mobilization.pl/files/baner-speaking-at.png"></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about challenges related to <code>ContentProvider</code> and data model in general we faced during 2 years of development of Base CRM for Android. Even if this particular topic does not concern you, the <a href="http://2013.mobilization.pl/agenda/">agenda</a> is ripe with other interesting Android topics: dependency injection with Dagger, Gradle, unit testing, continuous integration. It&rsquo;s not Android specific event &ndash; there are also several presentations about other mobile platforms.</p>

<p>If you already have other plans for October 26th, you want to share some war stories related to data model on Android or you just want to talk about Android with fellow geeks, I recommend you a MeetUp happening next week in Kraków: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/GDG-Krakow/events/142021512/">Android Tech Talks #3</a>. I&rsquo;ll give a short topic intro, which (I hope) will be followed by deep, insightful discussion.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally got some sleep after a really busy weekend. For the first time I had an opportunity to give a talk at the programming related conference. I was also responsible for a programming contest organized by the company I work at, I tried to push the new release of our product and, on top of that, I had to do some Christmas related stuff, so I didn&rsquo;t get much sleep.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to the programming. I gave the talk about standard synchronization pattern on Android (<code>SyncAdapter</code> + <code>Authenticator</code> + <code>ContentProvider</code>) during this year&rsquo;s edition of KrakDroid conference. Here are the slides:</p>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="356" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15668008" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="427"> </iframe>


<p>
<strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/chalup/sync-on-android">Sync on Android</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/chalup">chalup</a></strong></p>

<p>The link to recorded video can be found in the slideshare content description. I won&rsquo;t bother posting it here, because a) I gave the talk in Polish, and I try to keep the content of this blog in English b) I was really tired, at one point of the talk I had to stop and ask myself &ldquo;What the hell am I trying to say&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Although my talk was average and there are many things I might have done better, I&rsquo;m very happy I had an opportunity to give this talk. Public speaking is definitely outside of my comfort zone and I learned a lot. Here&rsquo;s the &ldquo;conference speaker checklist&rdquo; for my future self:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get some sleep</li>
<li><p>Do the test run of the talk in front of the mirror</p>

<p> I finished the slides for my presentation half an hour before giving it, so I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to rehearse it. There were few points during my talk when adding a slide with a summary would make things much clearer. Which brings me to the next point:</p></li>
<li><p>Recap</p>

<p> I&rsquo;m not sure how much the listeners who didn&rsquo;t knew anything about sync will remember from my talk. The recaps could help them remember at least some keywords they would be able to google later.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the test run of the talk in front of other people</p>

<p> But not any other people &ndash; you want your audience to be critical and at least a bit familiar with the topic. You want someone who will tell you that this part of the talk is boring or that part is not clear.</p></li>
<li><p>Get more sleep</p></li>
</ol>


<p>And finally, do not freak out &ndash; the hardest part is saying &ldquo;Hello, my name is&hellip;&rdquo;, the rest will pour out of you.</p>
