  <div class="entry-content"><p>First of all by QML I do not mean <a href="http://sneezy.cs.nott.ac.uk/QML/">this</a>, I mean <a href="http://developer.qt.nokia.com/doc/qt-4.8/qtquick.html">this</a>: a UI module of Qt, the cross-platform framework. The gals and guys at Nokia figured out that modern user interface cannot be fully described by static layout in a XML file. Microsoft figured out that too, but they chickened out and only extended XML a bit and added an &lsquo;a&rsquo; to file extension to make it look like something new. Nokians took a step further and created new language for declarative UI based on JavaScript called QML.</p>

<p>The QML UI components can be defined in two ways: it can be a QML file composed of other components (for instance that&rsquo;s the usual way to define the main UI file) or it can be a C++ extension. Both ways can be used together to create a plugin, which can be imported to your project.</p>

<p>And at last we reach the intended topic of this post: testing. What happens if some QML file defining a component is missing? What happens if the whole plugin is missing or the version of this plugin is lower than the one required by application? QML files are interpreted during runtime, so of course you get the runtime error. In the best scenario it limits the functionality of your app, in the worst case it renders it completely unusable.</p>

<p>But hey, you can catch most of those errors simply by clicking through your application, right? Not exactly, doing so only tells you that in works on one particular device. You might have some plugins already installed, but not included in application&rsquo;s package and your app will work only on the devices which happen to have those plugins, which is not very likely.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/works-on-my-machine-starburst_2.png">
That&rsquo;s exactly the error I made when I published the first version of &ldquo;Nu, Pogodi!&rdquo;. I submitted for Q&amp;A process an application with dependencies to Qt Components 1.1, build with the latest Qt SDK. I&rsquo;ve tested it thoroughly on some devices I had access to and via <a href="http://www.developer.nokia.com/Devices/Remote_device_access/">Remote Device Access</a> service (which BTW rocks; I wish there was a similar service for Android) and everything worked fine. The application was rejected by Q&amp;A, because at the end of 2011 there was some <a href="http://support.publish.nokia.com/?p=3766&amp;type=news">technical issues with Nokia Store and latest Qt</a> and I was told to rebuild my application with old SDK, which included only Qt Components 1.0. I&rsquo;ve tested my game again and everything worked so I published it to Nokia Store. Few days later I received first reviews &ndash; all negative, along the lines &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t work, beware&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Qt Smart Installer partially prevents those errors, but you still might shoot yourself in the foot in some cases. My game had dependencies to Qt Components 1.1, but the pkg file declared dependency to version 1.0, because it was created with old SDK. When my customers installed the game, the smart installer ensured only that version 1.0 is installed, but my game needed newer version and failed during runtime. I didn&rsquo;t caught this during testing, because all of my devices had latest Qt Components installed.</p>

<p>That was the &ldquo;How not to test your QML application&rdquo; part, now let&rsquo;s get to solution. It&rsquo;s really simple: downgrade all the stuff needed by your application to versions defined in pkg file. To check the current versions of Qt libraries and plugins I recommend using an excellent <a href="http://projects.developer.nokia.com/qtinfo">QtInfo tool</a>. To downgrade Qt you need the sis files distributed with <a href="ftp://ftp.qt.nokia.com/qtsdk/">old Qt SDK versions</a>.</p>

<p>This simple steps should ensure that your application will work properly on all supported devices. Nevertheless, you should prepare for failure and handle all runtime errors in a user friendly way. But that&rsquo;s the topic for another post&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/nupogodi.png"></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nu, pogodi!&rdquo; is the first application I&rsquo;ve published in Nokia Store (or any other app store, in fact). It&rsquo;s a remake of a classic handheld console game I used to play in my childhood: you had to place a wolf with a basket under one of four roosts to catch the eggs rolling from them. Despite the extreme simplicity and the obvious flaw in the game plot (namely: what the hell does the wolf need the eggs for?) the game was quite addictive and I spent many hours listening to the hypnotizing ticking of the falling eggs (if you played this game you know what I&rsquo;m talking about).</p>

<p>The handheld console I based my game on is actually a Russian clone of &ldquo;Egg&rdquo; game from Nintendo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Game &amp; Watch&rdquo; game series. The main difference is the graphics &ndash; instead of fox and hen the Russian clone featured the Wolf and the Hare from a &ldquo;Nu, pogodi!&rdquo; cartoon &ndash; hence the name of the game.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/handhelds.jpg"></p>

<p>At the beginning of 2011 I wanted to check out the Qt Quick, which was advertised by Nokia as the best thing since sliced bread. I never liked the go-through-a-boring-tutorials way of learning new things, so I started writing UI for a simple game instead. Few weeks later Nokia announced <a href="http://www.developer.nokia.com/Community/Wiki/The_Quick_Competition_2011Q1">Qt Quick Competition</a> &ndash; an event promoting Qt Quick introduced in Qt 4.7. I&rsquo;ve entered the competition with the early version of my game under the name <a href="http://projects.developer.nokia.com/PAGADI">&ldquo;Nu, Pagadi!&rdquo;</a> (which is, as I learned later, incorrect &ndash; apparently in Russian sometimes you write an &lsquo;o&rsquo;, but pronounce it as &lsquo;a&rsquo;), which didn&rsquo;t won me anything, but at least I had a motivation to work on the game. In accordance with the competition rules I&rsquo;ve published my code under OSS license and forgot about the whole deal.</p>

<p>In November 2011 I&rsquo;ve stumbled upon a &ldquo;Soviet Eggs&rdquo; game in Nokia Store. It seems that some company forked my competition entry, added a splash screen and the menu and charged 2 euros for it. I&rsquo;ve watched the gameplay videos on YouTube, and thought I can do much better version than them. I polished my game, added sound effects, better looking menu and new game mode which resembles the gameplay of original game much more than the one included in the competition entry. All those changes took me about one week worth of evenings and one weekend. Subsequentially I&rsquo;ve <a href="/blog/2012/01/22/how-not-to-test-your-qml-application">screwed up testing</a>, published to Nokia Store a game which silently crashed on 90% of the phones, fixed the problem, and then I screwed up again, this time when <a href="/blog/2012/01/31/updating-qt-applications-in-nokia-store">publishing the update</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the initial issues the game reached top 10 bestseller list in two weeks and stayed there ever since. Try it yourself!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been planning to start a blog for quite some time, but I kept finding excuses to put off writing. Not enough content, poor writing skills, not enough time &ndash; take your pick. What&rsquo;s changed? Not much really, except I said myself &lsquo;screw it&rsquo; and stopped procrastinating. I want to start a blog, so I have to sit down and write something, don&rsquo;t I? Call it my new year&rsquo;s resolution.</p>

<p>What will I write about? During my day job and in my free time I conduct a lot of research on programming for mobile devices and I want to document my work somewhere. I&rsquo;ve prepared a list of topics I&rsquo;d like to write about and I hope my research will provide enough content to keep this list full (and anyways, if I ever run out of interesting subjects I can always write &ldquo;top 10 blah&rdquo; or &ldquo;introduction to monads&rdquo; post). I&rsquo;ve started my professional career two and a half year ago as a Symbian OS programmer and I&rsquo;ve stayed in mobile world since then and wrote stuff for every significant mobile platform except iOS (but I do plan to change this soon). Currently I&rsquo;m programming mostly Android and Symbian apps.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m going to gloat about the stuff I wrote, rant about various gotchas in the world of programming for mobile devices and I hope that in the meantime I&rsquo;ll learn something and have some fun.</p>
